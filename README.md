## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

Thanks to this project, I've practiced some semantic HTML and CSS. The following snippets are some examples of the knowledges I used.

- Semantic HTML5 (`<footer>`):

```html
<footer>
  <address rel="author">Annie Spratt</address>
</footer>
```

- CSS (`.card`):

```css
.card {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  width: 23rem;
  margin: 15rem auto;
  padding: 1rem 0;
  border-radius: 1rem;
  box-shadow: 1rem 1rem 1rem #e5eaf0;
}
```

### Continued Development

HTML and CSS are the base when creating a web project, I will continue to master those technologies on some future project.
